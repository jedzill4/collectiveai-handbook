Nothing beats a good vacation to recharge, come back with fresh ideas and enthusiasm to share.

There is no limit to the amount of vacation days you can take, but be sure to use this freedom responsibly. Choose carefully which are the best dates, duration and distribution of your holidays.

Two things are required before you can take your vacations:

* Check that no one in the teams you're working with sees any issues with the date and duration of your vacations. Avoid overlapping with your teammates as much as possible. And, if you're working on your own, find someone to cover for you in case something urgent should arise.
* Let everyone know in advance. The notification should come with as much anticipation as the length of your vacations. For instance:
    * If you're taking Friday off you should notify it on Wednesday.
    * If you're taking a week off from Monday 11th to Friday 15th, you should notify on Friday the 1st.
    * If you're taking March off you should notify on the last day of January.

It's only necessary to make any arrangements about your vacation plans if you're going to stop working. In that case, make sure to cancel any appointments you have on your calendar for those dates, and set up the vacation responder for your email. On an administrative note, since we legally need to divide vacations from time off, we keep track of *[available vacation time](https://airtable.com/shrYKJpCajXFGRAbE/tblMeDnFP0hFqlder)*.

If what you want is a change of scenery, but you're going to keep on working, feel free to do that anytime. As long as meetings donâ€™t require you to be physically present, or connectivity is an issue, you can choose your location freely.

Bon voyage!
