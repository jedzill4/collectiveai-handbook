## The whys
First of all, we hired you because we consider you share the same values and principles which are important to us â€“if you have read any you highly disagree with, let us know soon! When we start off from a common base of shared values, everything else is about implementation details. Secondly, and paraphrasing [Joel Spolsky](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Gets-Things-Done-Technical/dp/1590598385), we hired you because we think you're smart and can do stuff. That last bit is really important: we are a group of people who MAKE stuff. We don't just think, suggest and design; we sit down and do.
