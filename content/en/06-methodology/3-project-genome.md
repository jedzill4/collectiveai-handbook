## Project Genome

Wanting to understand what kinds of projects we liked to engage in, and direct our commercial efforts to get better fits for that, we conducted a survey to evaluate which are the preferred characteristics we see in a project. Project Genome is the name of that initiative, and it led to [this visualization](https://genome.manas.tech/), which allows us to see how close each new project we are inspecting is to the ideal of what we like to do.
