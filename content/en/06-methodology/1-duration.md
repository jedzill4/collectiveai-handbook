## Duration

Most projects we take last from a few weeks up to a few months. You are free to choose to work on long-term projects if you enjoy working on a single challenge for a long time, watching it grow and having the chance to refactor code as the visibility of the problem improves. If, on the other hand, you prefer to start new projects often, rotate through different topics and teams and solve new issues, you can opt for shorter projects or continuously switch between the two. Here you can see a full list of the duration, scope and definitions of all our [ongoing projects](https://airtable.com/shrdXXwdf1POr7yzh/tbl4serdEgBv18iNs).
