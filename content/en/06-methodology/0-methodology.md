Every methodology is a combination of bureaucracy and adhocracy. If we turn too much towards bureaucracy, we lose the ability to adapt to new environments and we become slower and heavier. If we turn too much towards adhocracy, the difficulty of coordinating our work increases as we constantly switch around processes and methods which we adapt to our idiosyncrasies.
