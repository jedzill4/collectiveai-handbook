## Rules

1. You can allocate whatever raise you feel is right for each of your coworkers during each round, there are no limits and you don't have to assign something to everyone. If there's someone you haven't interacted with, or don't know what they do and you don't think you can judge them, don't worry. But do reward those who you think have added the most value to Manas. Be careful and take into account that your decisions are impacting heavily on everyone else's future.
2. For each round, your raise will be the average of every allocation you've got, and your final one, the sum of all rounds. The system will also show minimum, maximum and standard deviation.
3. Grab a drink with your coworkers and thank them for the raise.
