## Library

Most people at Manas are naturally curious and thankfully have a habit of sharing great stuff they come across, when they think it can help in the never-ending refining of our beloved practice. We have a [specific channel](https://manas.slack.com/archives/C02R1L3N9) for that and you can also [contribute new resources to our Library](https://airtable.com/shrepxLOZINQwO6Xl).
