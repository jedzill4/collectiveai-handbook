## Is this my seat?

Nope. Not in a strict way, at least. For the sake of positivity, we’ll say that it's as yours as any other seat in the office. After more than a year working remotely, however, it’s not really all that relevant.

But we can safely say that you can sit at any free desk you find. Once you start working in a project, find a place near the people you're working with. As you change projects or work with different people, change places as much as you need.
