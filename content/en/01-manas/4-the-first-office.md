## The first office

During another fit of naivety, and while the Argentine economy was collapsing on its usual 10-year cycle, he rented an office in the posh neighbourhood of Olivos. The office was close to the river but a little too close to the train tracks. The office started as a rather empty space, although it could pass as minimalist. With time, improvements and expansions were made, but despite the efforts, the main issue was that the team had outgrown the space[^1] and the horizon of growth was non existent[^2]. After a few years in that beloved spot, Manas relocated twice more. Our current headquarters sit nicely in Av. del Libertador, where we all fit much more comfortably - until the pandemic decided otherwise. We've since then kicked our already remote-friendly culture up a notch, and even opened the possibility to work from anywhere in the world.
