## Restrospectives

After each project comes to an end (be it final or temporary), we sit down to reflect on what went right or wrong, which things we enjoyed or suffered throughout the process, and what we would like to improve upon for next time. Feel free to ask your team for a retrospective when the project is over, or after any key event where it might be useful to observe the process from a distance.
