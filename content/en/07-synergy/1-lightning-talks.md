## Lightning Talks

We would love for you to present a talk on any topic that interests you. We call them Lightning Talks because the idea is that they last between 5 and 10 minutes. They usually take place on Wednesdays, among beer and snacks. The purpose of these talks is to share knowledge with the rest of the team and, incidentally, to exercise our presentation skills.
