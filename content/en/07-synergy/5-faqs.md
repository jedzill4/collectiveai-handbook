## FAQs

We want everyone in Manas to feel heard, and we want equal access to information, so we keep a [Frequently Asked Questions document](http://man.as/faq) where we log questions (and of course, answers) that anyone in Manas can benefit from. Feel free to add your own, if there’s anything unclear, but make sure it isn’t already answered in this handbook or in the FAQs document.
