## All for one

Even though most people are assigned to a particular project, you can pick the brains (do not take this literally, please) of anyone in the entire team for whatever you need. It makes no sense to go it alone with so many talented people around. When you get stuck, are in doubt or would like a second opinion, donâ€™t hesitate to ask [whoever you think will be able to help you](https://airtable.com/shrjzEqYh2o3DjIzN/tblTTOHywP86NHabS). If they can't, they will surely be able to recommend someone who will. We developed our own [Tech Radar](https://radar.manas.tech/) to optimize this process.
