# Hiring & interviewing

Once you're all settled and you understand how everything works, you might start feeling an urge to share Manas with others. When that happens, you can start to help with bringing people as great as you to the team by getting involved in the interview process.

As you can probably imagine, our hiring process is not exactly traditional. We get candidates as usual: an email arrives at [jobs@manas.tech](mailto:jobs@manas.com.ar) or we find them through online searches. But after that, it's pretty different. We don't usually send out postings with *"semi-senior programmers wanted with minimum three year experience in Java. UML basics appreciated"*.

We're always looking for the next perfect person to hire. The catch is that we do not exactly know how to find them by a list of skills or experience. That's where you come in. If you feel you would enjoy working with someone, it’s a good first sign that they might fit right in with us.

The interview process is simple: if a candidate reaches out to us or is recommended by someone, we begin with an initial interview which hopes to rule out serial killers, minors and [ABAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP) programmers *(not necessarily in that order)*. If that goes well, we perform a simple asynchronous evaluation of technical skills, to gauge what their technical level is.

This technical interview is key in the evaluation of the candidate’s salary across every component (except for the peer-review). Even though we share a core set of ideals and methods, the interviews themselves don't have a specific format and everyone is free to find their own style. The goals are, on one hand, to find out if the interviewee shares Manas' values, is smart and fits in with the kind of work we do; and on the other hand, to assign milestones in order to formulate a competitive salary offer.

Once the interview process is over, everyone involved has to decide between "YES HIRE" or "NO HIRE". We know sometimes you will not be entirely sure, or you might prefer to defer the decision to somebody else. That counts as a "NO HIRE". We don't want to take any chances: if the candidate wasn't great, then it's better to keep looking. Ultimately, the team will suffer much more from hiring a wrong candidate than from losing a good one.

Should everyone agree to hire them, an email with an offer will be sent to the candidate. Should they accept the offer, congratulations are in order: you've closed the loop.

The next steps are *[onboarding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KoxZSdGPQy4a6cV4FofDX87-MYlm4bei7HCKtrC8VGk/edit)* and project assignment. To make it easier and more fun, every new employee is assigned a buddy, who will be the leading point of contact for evacuating doubts and inquiries.
