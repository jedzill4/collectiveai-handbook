## Benefits

There are a number of benefits to this system. It allows for a better understanding of the remuneration each person in Manas perceives. It acknowledges and compensates human qualities and automatically keeps up with inflation. 

It is also a function of how we see our culture: we need a way to allocate resources without resorting to a hierarchical structure, and we want to maintain our systems and mechanisms as transparent and fair as possible.

Last but not least, it allows us to easily transition into hiring people all over the world in a transparent and streamlined way.
