# Do great work, have great fun

> A personâ€™s maturity consists in having found again the seriousness one had as a child, at play.<cite>Friedrich Nietzsche</cite>

We are all for multifaceted people, and we think that everything we do is subject to a different perspective given by our pastimes. Do you feel like doing yoga, swimming, origami or taking Japanese lessons? Manas will take care of the cost of whichever activity you want to take up. Acceptable ideas are sports, languages, courses, etc. Anything illegal or immoral is excluded. Ideally, you could share a little of the wisdom and experiences you've collected with the rest of the team.

We also spend time doing things that, while still pertaining to our work, are not billable. We [use keywords to track that time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gz3YkRP--FS7li3YMpEHd6Bf0k0PtL4_OA40CQzTgwM/edit) with the purpose of understanding where our focus goes.
