# Wait, I get a budget?

Everyone at Manas has access to an expense budget to cover the costs of things they need to improve the quality of their lives: be it work-related or else.

For a while, we had a few separate internal budgets that we used for different purposes, such as personal activities, training and conferences, events, and hardware. However, in 2016, we started exploring a more streamlined and unified system that could be used to approve any expense required.
The basic idea is simple: anybody can propose an expense to a group of people in the organization (we do it via a Slack channel) and get almost immediate approval on it.

## How it works

1. Every four months, [we revise our finances](https://manas.tech/blog/2019/12/13/automated-financial-modeling/) and determine the budget available for the next period. That is the total budget for all variable expenses.
2. Every person in Manas has control over the allocation of a fraction of that budget. The fraction each one can allocate is proportional to the total months they have been part of the organization. This ensures a progressive alignment with the culture and mutual trust to be developed before significant expenses can be approved individually.
3. There is no limit on the expense amount that anybody can propose, but the more significant the expense, the more people are typically needed to get it approved.
4. All expense proposals are visible internally.
5. Interested people can support the proposal.
6. Once enough support to fund the proposal is obtained, the proponent can approve the proposal.
7. Budget is deducted proportionally from the people that supported an expense proposal.
8. The expensing system is connected to our accounting software, pulls actual expenses, and matches them against their proposals, showing the details of how the money was spent.
9. The system also displays all variable expenses that don't match against any proposal and displays those as deductions to the available budget. Whenever an expense is charged but the person who made it forgot to make a proposal, or a contingency occurs, this ensures accountability. While people can still spend money without going through the process, that is transparently communicated and accounted for.
