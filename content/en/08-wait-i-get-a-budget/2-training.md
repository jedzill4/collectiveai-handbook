A wise man said: *"Continuity is decay"*. We hope you can learn and grow continuously, and for that Manas sets aside a budget for every period. 

You can use this budget on any sort of activity that'll help you grow in your role inside of Manas: language lessons, software conferences, books and seminars are all valid examples. The only limits to these expenses are common sense and the whole of the budget put together.
