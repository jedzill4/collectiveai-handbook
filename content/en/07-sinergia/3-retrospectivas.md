## Restrospectives
After each project is over, we sit down to reflect on what went right or wrong, which things we enjoyed or suffered through and what we want to improve upon for next time. Feel free to ask your team for a retrospective when the project is over or after any key event where it might be useful to observe the process from a distance.
