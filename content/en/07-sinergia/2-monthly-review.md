## Monthly reviews
We try to have a group presentation where one of the teams shares their latest work once a month. They will present which challenges they encountered and how they were attacked. The talks can vary in format and focal point, you can choose to make yours in whatever you think is most interesting: which technologies you used, a great algorithm, elegant design, a successfully solved usability issue, etc.
