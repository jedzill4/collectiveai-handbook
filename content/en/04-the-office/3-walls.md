## Walls

You'll sometimes notice that people stand up and write on the wall. They're not having a regression to childhood, but taking advantage of our writeable (and, more importantly, erasable!) walls. Feel free to use your favourite area as a blackboard. It should be fairly easy to figure out which ones can be written on but, if you have doubts, ask around and find the corner you like the most as a blackboard.
