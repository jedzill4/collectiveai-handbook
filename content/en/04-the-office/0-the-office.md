The current state of affairs in the world has drastically changed our relationship with our office. We miss it, and the chance it gave us to connect without screens in between. Though we always had a policy of freely deciding when we work and where we work from, in recent times we have taken that one step further, and hired people in other countries and continents.

What follows is a description of our lovely offices, that serves as a meta-description of how we conceive common spaces and collaboration.
