## Excellence

We want to excel in our field by designing, developing and delivering quality products on time. Beyond delivering value to our customers, this goal also acts as a compass that guides us in an exploration of our own potential, both as individuals and as a team.

In any domain, the constant search for excellence kindles a self-discovery process whose value exceeds that of the actual result. We will encourage every attempt you make at improving your skills and work style.

To that effect, since the first day you join Manas, you have access to a [budget](https://manas.tech/blog/2019/10/01/decentralized-expensing-system/) you can use to invest in your training. With that budget you can buy books or materials, attend courses, travel to conferences or do anything you think will help you grow. You can find out more in the [Training](../08-wait-i-get-a-budget/2-training.md) section.
