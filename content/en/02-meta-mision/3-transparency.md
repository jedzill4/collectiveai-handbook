## Transparency

We manage Manas transparently, both internally and externally. Transparency contributes to building trust and improves teamwork in pursuit of a common goal. Lack of transparency only adds friction and discomfort, and it gets in the way of productive interactions.

**There is no confidential information inside Manas.** Revenue, client fees, expenses and salaries are all freely available internally. We hope that beyond giving you visibility this will also encourage you to share suggestions and comments. If you see anything that you find strange or inefficient, please let us know. Within the [Compensation](../11-compensation/0-compensation.md) section you will understand some of the advantages of this principle.
