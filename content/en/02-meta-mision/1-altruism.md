## Altruism

We want to contribute to the happiness of the people who work at Manas. We all spend a significant part of our life in an "employment" situation, so we think it's fundamental that, as far as possible, our work environment adds to personal development in all of its aspects.

If you're unhappy or know of someone you think is unhappy, let others know and help us understand how to improve the situation. We hope you will enjoy your workday and, to complement this, you can check the [Do great work, have great fun](../08-wait-i-get-a-budget/3-do-great-work-have-great-fun.md) and [Vacations](../12-vacations/0-vacations.md) sections.
